I currently live in Durham, NC, working remotely for a software company based in Raleigh, NC. I started coding when I was introduced to programming in college with JAVA (yuck). Ever since, I’ve been in love with the idea of creating things out of nowhere. When I'm not programming, I enjoy playing soccer, grilling, drawing, traveling, and reading Russian literature.

Most of my experience is in Web Development (React, Nodejs, TypeScript). I've recently been getting familiar with C# and .Net as this is what we use at my current company.

## Why do you blog?

Mostly to document what I’ve learned and the projects I’m working on. I research things I find fascinating, then document my findings in a public post. Occasionally, I’ll write about topics unrelated to tech, with the hope that others will find them helpful, relevant, or interesting.

## Can you build my dream app?

It depends. If your idea excites me or aligns with my interests, I’d be happy to consider it.
